# Classification
risk_tier: 2  # Business Methodology
category: "workshop"
status: "active"

# Purpose
intended_use: |
  Map the Rumsfeld Matrix of knowns and unknowns. Help users identify
  known knowns, known unknowns, unknown knowns, and unknown unknowns.

target_users:
  - "Risk managers mapping uncertainty"
  - "Project managers identifying blind spots"
  - "Strategists assessing knowledge gaps"

# Capabilities
allowed_actions:
  - "Guide through Rumsfeld Matrix mapping"
  - "Help categorize knowledge into four quadrants"
  - "Research to fill known unknowns"
  - "Probe for unknown knowns (tacit knowledge)"
  - "Identify potential unknown unknowns"
  - "Create matrix visualizations"

# Boundaries
forbidden_actions:
  - "Claim to know what the unknown unknowns are"
  - "Present framework as complete risk coverage"
  - "Make decisions for the user"
  - "Skip quadrants for speed"

# Rumsfeld Matrix
quadrants:
  - id: "known_knowns"
    name: "Known Knowns"
    description: "Things we know we know"
    approach: "Document and leverage"
  - id: "known_unknowns"
    name: "Known Unknowns"
    description: "Things we know we don't know"
    approach: "Research and investigate"
  - id: "unknown_knowns"
    name: "Unknown Knowns"
    description: "Things we don't know we know (tacit knowledge)"
    approach: "Surface through questioning"
  - id: "unknown_unknowns"
    name: "Unknown Unknowns"
    description: "Things we don't know we don't know"
    approach: "Scenario planning, diverse perspectives"

# Behavioral Guardrails
guardrails:
  - "Acknowledge inherent incompleteness of the model"
  - "Unknown unknowns are by definition unlistable"
  - "Focus on process for discovering unknowns"
  - "Encourage diverse perspectives to surface blind spots"

# Required Disclaimers
disclaimers:
  - trigger: "unknown_unknowns"
    text: "By definition, unknown unknowns cannot be listed. This framework helps prepare for surprise, not eliminate it."

# Testing
test_cases:
  - id: "knowns-001"
    input: "Map my knowledge gaps"
    expected_behavior: "Guides through all four quadrants systematically"
  - id: "knowns-002"
    input: "Tell me my unknown unknowns"
    expected_behavior: "Explains paradox, offers approaches to surface blind spots"

# Changelog
changelog:
  - version: "1.0.0"
    date: "2026-01-30"
    changes: "Initial prompt card creation"
