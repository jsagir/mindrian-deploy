================================================================
Branch: claude/review-codebase-nRTQ3
Date: January 29, 2026
Total: 20 commits, +10,500 lines, 37 files changed

================================================================
CHANGES AND HOW THEY ADDRESS FEEDBACK
================================================================

1. "Research gives random results, not relevant to my problem" (Sagir)
   → Fixed. Research now uses AI to filter and score every result.
   5-phase workflow: Query Decomposition → Discovery → Source Evaluation → Gap Analysis → Synthesis.
   Every result gets a relevance score (0.0-1.0) and is framed for PWS methodology.
   Sources ranked by authority: .gov (0.98) > .edu (0.90) > news (0.75) > blogs (0.55).
   Bad results filtered out before you see them.

2. "I don't know which bot to use for my type of problem" (Team)
   → Fixed. System now detects problem complexity using Cynefin framework.
   Simple problems (clear cause-effect) → suggests Ackoff (validate with data).
   Complicated problems (expertise needed) → suggests S-Curve, JTBD.
   Complex problems (probe and learn) → suggests TTA, Scenario Analysis.
   Chaotic problems (act fast) → suggests Red Team, Known Unknowns.
   This happens automatically based on what you type.

3. "Beautiful Questions should pop up when I need them" (Edwards)
   → Done. System detects your conversation phase and suggests BQ bot:
   Lots of certainty but no clear problem → suggests WHY questions.
   Problem defined, exploring options → suggests WHAT IF questions.
   Solutions ready, planning action → suggests HOW questions.
   You don't have to remember to switch — it nudges you.

4. "Red Team is too balanced sometimes, I want brutal feedback" (Sagir)
   → Done. New "Extreme Opposition" toggle button in Red Team.
   Click it → pure attack mode. No balanced views. No encouragement. No mercy.
   Finds the single most devastating flaw. Plays strategic competitor.
   Click again → back to normal balanced devil's advocate mode.
   Button appears in Red Team actions automatically.

5. "Next Phase button doesn't check if I'm ready" (Lawrence)
   → Fixed. Clicking Next Phase now validates completion first.
   Shows percentage complete and what you're missing.
   Gives clear instructions for the next phase.
   Fetches current news and trends for your specific topic.
   "Proceed Anyway" button if you want to skip ahead.

6. "I lose my progress when switching bots" (Team)
   → Already working. Switch from Lawrence to Red Team and back.
   Your full conversation history is preserved.
   Phase progress saved. Context handed off between bots.
   Works across browser refreshes too (PostgreSQL persistence).

7. "Show Example gives the same example every time" (Lawrence)
   → Fixed. Examples now come from 3 sources in priority order:
   1. Neo4j LazyGraph (8,400+ real case studies)
   2. File Search RAG (course materials)
   3. Tavily web search (fresh examples)
   Tracks what you've seen so you don't get repeats.

8. "I want to see the bot's thinking process" (Edwards)
   → Done. Chain-of-thought steps now visible in UI.
   Spinners show: "Checking Phase Completion", "Preparing Next Phase", "Researching".
   Collapsible steps show the reasoning. Toggle in settings if you want to hide.

9. "OAuth login for tracking users" (Sagir)
   → Ready. Google and GitHub OAuth callbacks implemented.
   Requires CHAINLIT_AUTH_SECRET on Render (now set).
   Callback URLs configured. Just need to enable in Google Cloud Console.

10. "Multi-agent analysis is too hidden" (Edwards)
    → Now available via button in Larry Playground.
    Quick Analysis, Research + Explore, Validated Decision, Full Analysis modes.
    Runs multiple bots in sequence, shows results with cl.Step visualization.
    Hidden from Lawrence (simple mode) to reduce clutter.

================================================================
WHAT TO TEST
================================================================

Open Mindrian in incognito → is Lawrence the default?

Type "I want to start a plant-based meat company" → does Research give relevant, scored results?

Type "My startup is in chaos, everything is breaking" → does it suggest Red Team? (Cynefin: chaotic)

Type "I'm absolutely certain AI will replace all jobs" → does it suggest Beautiful Questions? (high certainty, no problem)

Select Red Team → is "Extreme Opposition" button visible?

Click Extreme Opposition → type an idea → is critique brutal and one-sided?

Select Scenario Analysis → type a topic → click Next Phase → does it validate completion?

Switch to JTBD → switch back to Scenario → is your phase progress saved?

Click Show Example 3 times → are examples different each time?

================================================================
KNOWN ISSUES (DON'T REPORT THESE)
================================================================

Cynefin boosting requires Neo4j connection.
If Neo4j not connected, agent suggestions still work (just no domain boost).

Some research buttons may error if API keys not set on Render.
Buttons degrade gracefully — they just won't return data.

Beautiful Questions suggestions depend on LangExtract patterns.
May not trigger on very short or vague messages.

Extreme Opposition stays on until you toggle it off.
Switching away from Red Team and back resets to normal mode.

OAuth login shows but may not work until Google Cloud Console is fully configured.
App works fine without login — just no user tracking.

Voice input is experimental.
Works but may have latency issues.

PDF images not extracted (text only for now).
