# Welcome to Mindrian

**Your AI-Powered Innovation Workshop Platform**

Mindrian helps you identify and solve **Problems Worth Solving (PWS)** — a proven methodology for validating ideas before investing time and resources into solutions that may not address real needs.

---

## What is PWS?

**Problems Worth Solving** is a structured approach to innovation that ensures you're working on problems that matter. Instead of jumping to solutions, PWS helps you:

- Clarify what the **real problem** is (not symptoms)
- Validate that the problem **actually exists** with evidence
- Understand **who experiences** the problem and how
- Determine if **solving it matters** (impact, urgency, willingness to pay)

## Tips for Best Results

- **Be specific** — "How do I grow my business?" is less helpful than "Why are enterprise customers churning after 3 months?"
- **Bring evidence** — Upload documents, share data, provide examples
- **Challenge yourself** — If the AI agrees too easily, ask it to play devil's advocate
- **Iterate** — Great problem definitions often take multiple passes
